# Smart Traffic Control System Simulation

This project simulates a smart traffic control system where traffic signals automatically respond to an approaching ambulance. The simulation demonstrates how traffic lights dynamically change to facilitate emergency vehicle movement through traffic.

## Features
- Real-time ambulance movement along a predefined route
- Dynamic traffic signal control based on ambulance proximity
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Realistic traffic light timing
- Visual representation of roads, intersections, and vehicles

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Pygame 2.5.2
- Numpy 1.24.3

## Installation
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Simulation
Run the simulation using:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Controls
- ESC: Exit simulation
- SPACE: Restart simulation
